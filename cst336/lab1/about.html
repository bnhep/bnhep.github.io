            <!-- List of hobbies and interests -->
            <ul>
                <li><span class="hobby">Programming</span>: My interests in programming began when I was a little kid developing custom maps for the video game Warcraft 3. My first exposure was to
                the games scripting language JASS which was used to control every aspect of the game. I have slowly built upon my programming skills since then but only recently decided to
                take it serious and hone my skills while attending university.</li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Video games</span>: My interests in video games expands to most genres but most notably ARPGs and MMORPGs. In the past
                I would be heavily engaged in Call of Duty and League of Legends due to its competitive gameplay.</li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Fishing</span>: I have recently picked up sports fishing. My favorite method of fishing is surf-fishing which involves walking
                along the shorelines to catch fish against the currents of the waves. Other methods include float-tubing in mountain lakes such as those in the Eastern Sierras.</li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Cycling</span>: I am an avid road cyclist although I don't compete in tournaments. I challenge myself everyday to cycle long distances,
                notably my longest rides were around 200 miles. In addition I am also active in mountain biking.</li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Music</span>: My favorite genre of music is Alternative/Indie rock and Midwest Emo. Although I would listen to anything if it sounds good to me.</li>
            </ul>
