                <p>Driven by a growing passion for developing innovative solutions in the healthcare space,
                I am pursuing a career in Healthtech to help transform medical care into a more efficient, effective, and future-ready experience.</p>
                <p>My current goals is to complete the CS program at CSUMB to gain proficiency in a multitude of programming languages, 
                understanding the process in which software is developed in adept professional settings, and working towards collaboration among similar individuals.</p>

                <p>As 2025 comes to a close, I have completed five of the twelve courses required for graduation. My experience so far has been phenomenal,
                from writing ethics papers on recent technological developments, to developing an Android game application in Android Studio,
                managing databases in MySQL and MongoDB, and learning the fundamentals of operating systems and computer networks.
                With many more classes to come in the following year, I am excited to continue building on these experiences and expand my technical and professional skills.</p>
