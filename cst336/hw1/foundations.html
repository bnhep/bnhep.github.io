            <h2>Foundations of Computer Graphics</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-adjust"> Computer Graphics is the involvment of a wide range of multi-discplinary fields ranging from physics, math, human-perception, engineering, design, and much more.
                It utilizes physics to model lighting and creating simulations of animation; mathematics to provide perception, transformations, describing shapes and visual perspectives; engineering 
                to fundamentally utilize data structures, algorithms, and computation in order to allocate the memory, bandwidth, and processing for creating the visual images.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-adjust">
                The basic principles and concepts for the field are not too complicated to understand. The general process of computer graphics is to create, modify, or work with digital image, which
                also includes those from the real world. First images are generated into models with the help of computer programs, they consists of either two types of graphic data that can be stored on
                the computer. One known as vector graphics which calls for mathematical formulas i.e linear algebra concepts, to create geometric images. The other is known as raster graphics which are a 
                grid of dots predominantly known as pixels. Utilizing these graphical data the computer can create 2D, 3D or even animated images.
                
                Though the process is not just getting the data and creating the images. It has to undergo a process known as the Graphic Pipeline. The data must be processed in some way to even display it
                on our screens. Over the years computer graphics programmers have developed tools and softwares to operate on graphical data and render the images across different systems. Some notable mentions are the
                OpenGL or Open Graphics Library which provides an API to operate on graphical data and DirectX to help software facilitate image communication with hardware.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-adjust">
                Let's take a look at the graphics pipeline. This process encompasses the way computers turn graphical data, 3D models, and images to display on the screen.
                The process is analogous to an assembly line for creating a picture. First, it undergoes modeling which mentioned before creates the objects using either vector or raster graphics.
                Next is the transformation, how the objects are positioned, scaled, and rotated so that they can properly be displayed. It then uses lighting and shading to give it some clarity. Lastly,
                it can either go into projection which involves converting a 3D image to 2D for your screen, rasterization to turn the pixels into its final form, and lastly displaying it by sending the data to
                the screen and seeing the rendered results. This is just a general overview of the pipeline but just to note there is so much more happening behind the scenes like which algorithms are used to render the images, how software is communicating with the hardware
                , and the complicated math theories. Moving on, below are maybe the three important parts of the pipeline for creating computer graphics dubbed as <a href="https://youtu.be/5egHuZ0KU-c?si=hJ2Dy_mM88B1aum0&t=216" target="_blank"> The Three Pillars </a>.

            <h2>The Three Pillars</h2>
            <h4><span class="applications">Modeling</span></h4>
            <p class="paragraph-adjust"> The basis of modeling is specifically using the mathematical formulas to specify the shape and appearance properties such as the 
               size, color, texture, and positional parameters. In a sense it is building the form of the image, coming together from the surface or canvas in which it is created on.
               Some notable modeling software includes Blender, Maya, and Zbrush which allows for developers to create stylized objects for their medium. 
            </p>
            
            <h4><span class="applications">Rendering</span></h4>
            <p class="paragraph-adjust"> Rendering is the process where the computer converts the 3D scene or model data into a generative 2D image to be displayed on the screens. Essentially it is like
                adding the final touches to the canvas by creating the lighting and depthness. Unreal Engine is a popular rendering software for video games and more.
            </p>

            <h4><span class="applications">Animation</span></h4>
            <p class="paragraph-adjust"> Animation involves displaying the images with an illusion of motion. It creates life for the image by creating sequences of the images using frames over some time.
                Some notable animation softwares include Maya and Blender.
