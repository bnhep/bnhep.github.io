                <h2>What is Computer Graphics?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-adjust">
                    Computer Graphics is a field at the intersection of computer science and art that focuses on the the way in which computers produce and work with visual content. It involves creating,
                    transforming, displaying and manipulating images of all forms and shapes, examples such as both 2D and 3D representations. It encompasses modeling, rendering, and visualization techniques,
                    as well as the development of software tools that allow users to design, animate, and interact with digital imagery.

                <h2>Why Computer Graphics?</h2>

                <p class="paragraph-adjust">
                    According to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hughes-computer-graphics-3-e/9780133373721/" target="_blank"> Hughe's book of Computer Graphics Principles and Practice </a>
                    , Computer Graphics bridges the communication and interaction between humans and computers. When you think about it, modern societies encounter computer graphics every day, 
                    from the displays on our phones and televisions to the very screen you're using to browse this website. Computer Graphics plays an important role in how we experience and interact
                    with technology, this makes it essential to gather a better understanding of how these visualizations are created. Let's explore the general overview of what makes up this interesting
                    field of Computer Graphics.
