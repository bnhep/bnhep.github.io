                <h2>What is Computer Graphics?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-adjust">
Computer graphics, like the term suggests, is the process of creating imagery using computer programs and tools. In order to successfully create computer graphics, you have to understand the fundamentals of design and how to work with computer software to apply texture mapping, shadows, color, and more.

                <h2>Why computer graphics?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-adjust">
The field of computer graphics has influenced much of humanity’s daily lives, empowering designers to create dynamic visuals and expand the possibilities across numerous industries.

For example, in medical imaging, computer graphics help doctors interpret data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other tests. In engineering, it replaces physical models and prototypes to speed the design process. Additionally, computer graphics paved the way for emerging technologies like virtual reality, a simulated environment that only exists within computers or online spaces.
