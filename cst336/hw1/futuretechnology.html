                    Computer Graphics, although being prominent in our everyday life is still a growing field. The advancement of real-time rendering, GPU technology, and AI have rapidly increased
                    productivity and allows developers to create visualizations faster than before. The future of this technology may reach new potentials with the next step being Real-Time photorealism,
                    Quantum or Cloud rendering, and advancement in AI-generated materials. It's likely to focus on concepts such as immersion with augmented reality with large-scale visuals and realistic
                    motion capture. While the advancements for these technologies are great they do raise some ethical questions presumably in artistic ownership, authenticity of mediums, and scalability along with
                    the environmental impacts.

                <p>
                    Specialists at NASA are working to make visual scientific data more engaging with general population. By doing so they are converting raw sattelite-model data
                    into visualizations using graphical tools such as Houdini, Maya and custom graphical piplining. The underlying problem is that the visualizations are large-scaled reaching 
                    issues with computational power and decisions for how much data can be shown.
